            <h3>Week 1–2: Consultation(1) & Planning</h3>
            <p>Met with my GL Facilitator Ms Vera Tay with my groupmate Nazrin, We discussed our project goals and initial ideas. After that, we created a project timeline and assigned roles for each other.<br><br> I have always been interested in game genre like Roguelike, excited to be able to create it for Guided Learning. This module has given me an opportunity to explore game designing & programming and opened up possibilities for a career in the gaming industry.
            <br><br><strong>Completed:</strong> Setting up Unity project, Planning Game Developent Directions, Main character movement and project folder structure.

            <h3>Week 3–4: Prototype & Consultation(2)</h3>
            <p>Week 3-4 was focused on developing the initial prototype and adding the game logics such as wave manager to spawn different enemies. I think that week 3-4 went well since we already got the ball rolling and we knew what to do per week thanks to the planning we did in the learning contract. <br><br>When we were doing the Skeleton enemy, we were met with issues such as animation and its logic (attacking, moving), it tested our resilience and we spent time coming together to communicate in solving this issue. Although it was frustrating at first, the experience strengthened our teamwork and resilience and i feel that it helped us to grow technically and also in how we support each other when we encounter a problem.</p>
            <p><strong>Completed:</strong> Enemies (Goblin, Skeleton), Player control adjustments and Death scene panel implemented.</p>

            <h3>Week 5–6: Feedback & Improvements</h3>
            <p>We Conducted a survey with playtesters to gather feedback on the game prototype, however we were met with feedbacks that isn't unique and what we were already expecting. If i were to conduct another playtesting session i have to be mindful of adding specific questions to gather more insightful feedback that can guide our next steps. <br><br>New enemies comes with new challenges and this time it was the Flying Bat! It was a unqiue enemy idea that we had where the bat is not killable and it roams around, player has to avoid it or hit it to briefly stun it. Designing and implementing was thankfully simpler as we knew how to resolve it thanks to the Skeleton issue we faced in the earlier weeks. I feel that Week 5-6 was used productively as we are halfway through the project. Our way of resolving an issue has become faster and more efficient as our teamwork has improved. I am proud to see what we have created so far, especially my teammate Nazrin who knew nothing about Games Programming and now he is able to script and animate characters.</p>
           <p><strong>Completed:</strong> Enemies (Mushroom, Flying Bat), Playtest survey conducted, Shop system and design.</p>
